**       padding.
**  25   3dfx      1.24        01/19/00 Adam Briggs     for some strange reason,
**       display driver escapes don't seem to work in DOS.
**  24   3dfx      1.23        01/19/00 Adam Briggs     Made minihwc use either
**       EXT_HWC or EXT_HWC_OLD depending on which one the display driver supports

**  18   3dfx      1.17        12/10/99 Leo Galway      Removed previous hi-res
**       mode information for Glide3. These modes were only necessary for
**       Cornerstone (or future hi-res) support in RT4.2 source branch and
**       proceeded to break the V3 and V2 builds (from 3dfx view), hence they have
**       been removed.
**  17   3dfx      1.16        12/09/99 Leo Galway      Added mode information for
**       1600x1280, 1792x1440, 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 2046x1536 (as a result of
**       glide3 being tested with Cornerstone modes). Although not all of these
**       modes are capable under Glide3, their inclusion prevents Glide3 test apps
**       from being displayed incorrectly in theses hi-res modes. 
**       Search for SUSTAINED_ENGINEERING_CHANGE_BEGIN.
